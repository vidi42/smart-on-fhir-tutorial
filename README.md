# SMART on FHIR Tutorial

Sample Java Spring application to guide through the SMART on FHIR OIDC flow.

The application only supports the [Provider Standalone Launch Type](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/app-launch.html#launch-app-ehr-launch) for now, but hopefully more will be added later.

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repository
2. `./gradlew build`
3. `./gradlew bootRun`
4. Open http://localhost:8080 in the browser
5. Follow the flows in there
